# House Escape
House Escape is a 2D game built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) where you play a little boy who has been kidnapped and trapped inside of his kidnapper's house and needs to find his way out.


## Start the project

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm comes with Node.js by default).
- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

### Commands
Start a development server on localhost:8080.
```
npm run dev
```
&nbsp;
Build for production (**the code and the webpack config aren't optimized for production!**).
```
npm run build
```

## Development notes
This project was originally written in JavaScript and was the final project of my second year in college. I wanted to learn TypeScript and I thought it would be a good exercise to rewrite this game in TypeScript (and take some time to refactor the code because it was pretty bad...).  
House Escape is fully written in TypeScript and playable in a browser!
